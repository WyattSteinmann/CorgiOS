NOTE: This Project Is Kinda Dead But Not Yet I Am Still Working On 0.0.2 But It May Come Out From 2 Days To Cosmos 3rd Gen To 10 Years.
I Got Board And I Am Working On A New OS In Rust Cosmos Is Not It Any More It Was Really Cool When I Started But Now It's Got Problems:
  Network Is Almost Imposable
  It Compiles To X86 In Years That Will Be As Old As The Dinos And Yes Cosmos 3rd Gen Will Prob Fix This But By Then I Will Prob Have My Rust OS Done
  It's Hard To Get Any Work Done Yes It's C# But It's Just Hard To Do OS Things Like Running ASM With Out ASM It Make's It Hard To Write Drivers Or A Working Executable System Etc.
  It's Just Not Easy To Continue When I Can Do This Better In C, Rust And/Or ASM
